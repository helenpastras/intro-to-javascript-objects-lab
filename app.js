// Exercise 3
// 1. Add a new property to the `game` object. Let's call it "difficulty".
// 2. Choose a value for "difficulty" that you think fits the game. Ex: "Easy", "Med" or "Hard". How would you assign it?


// Solve Exercise 3 here
//   added above in the game: 
//  difficulty: ['Easy', 'Intermediate', 'Hard', 'Pro-level'],


// Exercise 4: 
// Exercise 4
// 1. Select a starter Pokémon from the `pokemon` array. Remember, a starter Pokémon's `starter` property is true.
// 2. Add this Pokémon to the `game.party` array. Which array method will you use to add them?
let starterPok;
console.log(pokemon[1]);
for (let i = 0; i < pokemon.length; i++) {
        if (pokemon[i].starter === true) {
            starterPok = pokemon[i];
            game.party.push(starterPok)
        }
    };
    console.log(game.party);

// Exercise 5
// 1. Choose three more Pokémon from the `pokemon` array and add them to your party.
// 2. Consider different attributes like 'type' or 'HP' for your selection. Which array method will you use to add them?
game.party.push(pokemon[30]);
game.party.push(pokemon[39]);
game.party.push(pokemon[79]);
console.log(pokemon[30]);
console.log(pokemon[39]);
console.log(pokemon[79]);
console.log(game.party);

//Exercise 6
// 1. Set the `completed` property to true for gyms with a difficulty below 3.
// 2. Think about how you'd loop through the `gyms` array to check and update the `completed` property. 


// Exercise 7
// 1. Evolve the starter Pokémon you added to your party earlier. Each starter Pokémon evolves into a specific one.
// 2. How would you replace the current starter Pokémon in your party with its evolved form?

// Hint: 
//   - Pokemon 1: Bulbasaur evolves into Pokemon 2: Ivysaur
//   - Pokemon 4: Charmander evolves into Pokemon 5: Charmeleon
//   - Pokemon 7: Squirtle evolves into Pokemon 8: Wartortle
//   - Pokemon 25: Pikachu evolves into Pokemon 26: Raichu

// More Hints: The existing starter Pokemon will be *replaced* in your party with the Pokemon it evolved into. When working with an array of objects, the splice() array method is ideal for replacing one element with another. 


// Solve Exercise 7 here:


// Exercise 8
// 1. Print the name of each Pokémon in your party.
// 2. Consider using a loop or an array method to access each Pokémon's name.

// Solve Exercise 8 here:


// Exercise 9
// 1. Can you print out all the starter Pokémon from the `pokemon` array?
// 2. Think about how you can identify a starter Pokémon and then log their names.
